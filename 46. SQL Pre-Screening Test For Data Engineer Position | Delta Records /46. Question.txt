Question:

There is a live production system with a table('ORDERS') that captures order information in real-time.
We wish to capture "deltas" from this table(inserts and deletes) by leveraging a nightly copy of the
table. There are no timestamps that can be used for delta processing.


ORDER:
ORDER_ID(PRIMARY_KEY)

This table processes 10,000 transactions per day, including INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs. The
DELETEs are physical, so the records will no longer exist in the table.

Every day at 12:00AM, a snapshot(copy) of this table created and is an exact copy of the table at that time.

ORDER_COPY:
ORDER_ID(PRIMARY_KEY)

Requirement:
Write a query that(as efficiently as possible) will return only new INSERTs into ORDER since the snapshot was taken
(record is in ORDER, but not ORDER_COPY) OR only new DELETEs from ORDER since the snapshot was taken(record is
in ORDER_COPY, but not ORDER)

The query should return the Primary Key(ORDER_ID) and a single character
("INSERT_OR_DELETE_FLAG") of "I" if it is an INSERT, or "D" if it is a DELETE.

For example, consider the Venn Diagram below depicting Inserts and Deletes and the desired result set:

ORDER table:      ORDER_COPY:
------------      -----------
Inserts 5678      Deletes 1234

Sample Result:

ORDER_ID    INSERT_OR_DELETE_FLAG
1234        "D"
5678        "I"

Rule - Not to use minus, union, merge, union all... exist and not exist can be used.
