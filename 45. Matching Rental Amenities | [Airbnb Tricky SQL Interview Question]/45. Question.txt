Matching Rental Amenities

The Airbnb Booking Recommendation team is trying to understand the "substitutability" of two rentals
and whether one rental is a good substitute for another. They want you to write
a query to determine if two Airbnb rentals have the same exact Amenities offered.

Output the count of matching rental ids.

Assumption:
- if property1 has kitchen and pool, and property 2 has kitchen and pool too, then it is a good 
substitute and represents a count of 1 matching rental.
- if property3 has kitchen, pool and fireplace, and property4 only has pool and
fireplace, then it is not a good substitute
